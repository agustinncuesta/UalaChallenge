### Considerations

* Architecture
  
MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel): This architecture was chosen because it provides a clear separation of concerns between the UI and business logic, making the app easier to maintain and test.

Scalability: Some layers have been created for reusable components. Some folders have been created and named accordingly to prepare for future modularization.


* Search Optimization
  
The search was optimized by using a dictionary, which provides fast O(1) average-time complexity for lookups by key.
